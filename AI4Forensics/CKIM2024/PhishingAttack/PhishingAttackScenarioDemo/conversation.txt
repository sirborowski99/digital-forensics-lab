Alice: Hey Bob, I just got a strange email from support@banksecure.com. It says I need to verify my account details urgently. The subject line was "Urgent: Verify Your Account Now". The email looks suspicious to me.

Bob: Hi Alice, that does sound fishy. Can you forward me the email? I’ll take a look at the headers to see where it came from.

Alice: Sure, forwarding it now.

Bob: Got it. Let’s see... The email came from IP address 192.168.10.45, but the domain banksecure.com is not their official domain. It's actually registered to someone in Russia.

Alice: That’s definitely not right. Should I be worried?

Bob: We should investigate further. Did you click on any links or download any attachments?

Alice: I did click on a link that took me to a page asking for my login credentials. I didn't enter anything though. The URL was http://banksecure-verification.com/login.

Bob: Good call on not entering your details. Let’s check the URL. This domain was just registered two days ago. It’s highly likely it’s a phishing site.

Alice: What should I do next?

Bob: First, clear your browser history and cache. Also, run a full antivirus scan on your computer. Can you also provide me with any browser history entries and cookies from that session?

Alice: I’ve cleared the history and started the antivirus scan. Here are the relevant entries from my browser history:
Visited at 10:15 AM: http://banksecure-verification.com/login
Visited at 10:17 AM: http://banksecure-verification.com/account-details

Bob: Thanks. I’ll analyze these URLs further. Also, check if there are any suspicious files downloaded or present in your downloads folder. Look for anything unusual.

Alice: There's a file named "AccountDetails.exe" that I don’t remember downloading. It was created at 10:20 AM.

Bob: Definitely suspicious. Don’t open it. Let’s hash the file to verify its integrity. Can you run an MD5 hash on it?

Alice: Done. The MD5 hash is e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03.

Bob: This hash matches known malware in our database. We’ll need to quarantine it and check if it has established any network connections. I’ll look into our network logs for the IP 192.168.10.45 around 10:20 AM.

Alice: Is there anything else I need to do?

Bob: For now, avoid using your computer for sensitive tasks. We’ll also reset your passwords from a different device and enable two-factor authentication on your accounts.

Alice: Thanks, Bob. I’ll follow these steps immediately.
