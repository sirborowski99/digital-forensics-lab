    "\n",
    "The case study demonstrates how to Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to gain political insight based on a leaked [email](https://github.com/benhamner/hillary-clinton-emails?tab=readme-ov-file) dataset from Hillary Clinton's private email server. \n",
    "- The email dataset is a comprehensive collection of communications covering her entire tenure as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. \n",
    "- It includes approximately 30,000 emails with a wide range of topics from official diplomatic communications to personal correspondences. \n",
    "- The release and subsequent analysis of these emails have played a crucial role in political debates, legal inquiries, and public discussions about transparency and security in government communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals of analysis with a LLM\n",
    "- Input for LLM: emails with various political scenarios, historical events, or current affairs related to Israel\n",
    "- Task for LLM: analyze emails from a political, social, and economic perspective \n",
    "    - provide insights into the implications of these scenarios, \n",
    "    - how they reflect on Israel's domestic and foreign policy, and \n",
    "    - what potential outcomes or future developments could arise from them.\n",
    "- Output: analyze results\n",
    "    - No specific format is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset in this study\n",
    "A set of email summaries (138 paragraph) from the leaked email dataset\n",

    "    - some emails is very long. LLMs have token limitation\n",
    "- summarization is done by Gemini \n",
